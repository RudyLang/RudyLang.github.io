A good friend of mine commissioned me to create his Youtube banner. 
His channel is called [Nostora Nonstop]() and he's putting out new LPs every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday!

He asked for a blade that contained the night, with strong purple and blue hues. The hilt should match the purple, and the pommel should be mounted with a black jewel.

I wanted the text to compliment the purples and blue while maintaining high contrast. White had the most pop, so I used that for his name. And for the trailing "Nonstop" I went with a golden/peachy hue to match the hilt. I also added cuts in the font to make it appear as if it's taken some sword slashes.

I'll also be animating everything to give him a cool intro. More to come!
